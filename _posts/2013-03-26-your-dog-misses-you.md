In our last post, we touched on how a home pet carer can help to remove the anxiety of placing your pet in a boarding kennels or cattery while you are away.

Dogs in particular form a special bond with their humans and we can have no doubt that they miss us when we're not there. We know this from scientific research (check out [this study](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-dogs-bond-with-owners-similar-to-babies-with-parents/) for just one example), but most of all, we know this from how our dogs behave when we leave them, and how they greet us when we come home (one of the many things we love about them, right?!). Because the truth is, when we leave, they don't know when - or if -  we're coming back. When you look at it like this, it makes sense that we are welcomed home as if  we've been away for a fortnight, when in fact we've just nipped out to the post office for five minutes.

Add to this the strange, new environment of a boarding kennels, surrounded by lots of unfamiliar dogs and humans, we cannot be surprised when our pooches become anxious and out of sorts. Not what you should be worrying about while you're lying on a beach somewhere exotic, trying to relax!

By offering home visits, tailored specifically to the needs of your pet, jinming enables you to keep your pet at home while you are away. Remaining in their usual surroundings and familiar routine can minimise the anxiety your dog might experience while you're away for any length of time.

Better still, if that home pet carer is the dog's regular walker, they will already be a familiar friend and a welcome visitor to your home. It's lucky, then, that we offer dog walking too (but that's because we love you).
