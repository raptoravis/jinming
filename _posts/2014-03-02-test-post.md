Start things off with a little intro. This bit of text before the "more tag" below, will appear as the excerpt on the blog page, and also as the text before the YouTube video, if you inlclude one.

<!--more-->

The rest of the post, goes here. If you included a YouTube link by adding the the youtubecode code in the front matter at the top of this file, this text will appear after it.

You can create a new paragraph as normal. Carriage returns are all understood.
