<h1>We look after your pets, while you take a pause</h1>
<p>
	We are a small, friendly home petcare service based in St Albans.
</p>
<p>
	Whether you're going on holiday or just working long hours, we can visit your home to ensure your pet is cared for and exercised while you are away.
</p>

<h2>Why home visits?</h2>
<p>
	Having a home pet carer prevents the stress and medical risks of placing your pet in a kennels or cattery. Staying at home while you are away ensures that your pet keeps its usual routine in familiar surroundings.
</p>


<h2>Over and above</h2>
<p>
	As part of our standard service, we will provide you with regular updates from your pet - via your choice of text or email - so that you can relax in the knowledge that your pet is happy and well cared for in your absence.
</p>
<p>
	Should your pet need regular medication and/or visits to the vet we are <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/info">fully insured</a> to do this for you. We believe that maintaining a routine is particularly important for animals that are elderly or in ill health.</p>
<p>
	And it’s not just <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/cat-services">cats</a> and <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dog-services">dogs</a>. We understand the additional care and attention that puppies and kittens need while you are away and happy to create a care package thats caters for this. We can also look after any small caged pets or fishtanks in your absence.
</p>
<p>
	We are happy to accommodate any special requirements your pet may have, however big or small!
</p>
